The DIY Onewheel is complete. I'll be wrapping up this build log in this post. I'm calling this version one. There were some problems with the build detailed bellow.

#### BMS and battery.

I'm using a 10s3p battery. The BMS connects on the anode side, shown above, a XT60 connector for the load, and a XT30 connector for the charging plug.

BMS with the nickle strips attached so that it can be bolted to the battery terminals.

Here is the battery in half of its printed casing. The caps either side of the 18650 cells are a kit made by Vruzend. Since I didn't have access to a spot welder for this summer project this was a good way to build a large battery quickly without destroying the cells with solder. However a lot of the battery caps cracked and had to be replaced on another battery I built with this kit. I'm not impressed with the quality and I've since ordered a spot welder for future battery projects.

#### Cut and drill.
