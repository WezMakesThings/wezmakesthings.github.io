### Working Outline

Wind Power segment.

- Background of Solar Holler.
- Disadvantages of Solar pannels in Eastern KY
- Initial background info regarding wind power
-Potential implemetations.

There have been many attempts to bring renewable alternatives to Coal energy into Easter KY. One program is known as Solar Holler, which operates all through appilacia. However the mountains in the region reduce the average daylight that any point recieves. making solar pannels generate less power than if they were in other regions. Initial research in the region by [insert citation] suggests that wind power may be the answer. The mountains create channels that create a very linear flow of air that can be harnessed with cheap turbines designed for one direction of wind. Wind power is also scaleable enough to use as either a local small source on an building or can be placed on the sides of hill where construction of homes is difficult or impossible.

### Proposal

We started our rhetorical analysis by looking into how climate change is effecting impoverished communities across the world. This led to quite a few essays that ended up focusing on Africa. However this is not all that useful for making a documentary as there are not many primary sources we could gather from that part of the world. We've begun to try and shift our focus to a more local setting. One idea we've explored is rather than focusing so much on climate change itself we could focus on renewable/sustainable practices being implemented locally. I was born in eastern Kentucky and the area is very dear to me despite it being far removed from most of my life. There have recently been initiatives to create and encourage renewable jobs in these areas that are typically mineral resource based economies. This is one interesting angle that could be investigated for a documentary. The need for, effects and acceptance (or lack there of) of these projects. An interesting angle that could be taken on this is: maybe solar isn't the answer despite it being the common focus of these initiatives like [Solar Holler](https://www.solarholler.com/) an initiative to being solar energy production to Appalachia. However, the valleys and peaks of eastern Kentucky decrease the amount of sunlight that any given area gets in a day. Perhaps wind or geothermal energy would be better suited to the region. Preliminary research suggests that wind power could be a better fit for the region and create more sustained long term jobs. ["Even at lower elevations, the terrain and topography of mountains can create wind corridors with high wind speeds that are ideally suited for wind turbine development." ](http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/focusareas/cleanenergy/en/) The exploration of local renewable to revitalize outdated coal based economies and the communities response could be an interesting topic for a documentary.

### Revision Plan

The most common feedback I received from my peers was that it wasn't clear a) what the green wall project was, and b) who exactly my stakeholder was. The biggest overall change that needs to be made is that I need to add background information on the Great Green Wall and clarify my stakeholder. There are a lot of organizations involved in the Great Green Wall, while the project is led by the African Union, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification is a large contributor and created a lot of the media for the Great Green Wall on the behalf of the African Union. Therefore rather than muddy the waters by including both the African Union and UNCCD as my stakeholders I've chosen to simplify it to just the African Union and address the UNCCD later in the essay. I will also add more background information on the Great Green Wall in the intro and clarify that it is not a literal green wall and rather a planned forested area designed to prevent the continued spread of the Sahara southward. The other weakest are of my paper was the third paragraph where I discussed ways that the website built credibility. It was the last thing I wrote so it was very fuzzy, and didn't flow well. It didn't really get the point across at all. Lastly there was also a lot of mechanical mistakes and the flow of the whole paper needs to be touched on. Almost all the feedback I got was very helpful, every bit will make its way into the final draft somehow.

### Paperless* Student

#### Feb 1st 2020

I never intended to go paperless. I was always the person that preferred the feel of paper. When I started college I had a backpack full of notebooks for each class, a thick gaming laptop that had to have its beastly charger brought along too if I wanted to use it to do anything for more than an hour and whatever textbook I had for the day. My Dell G7 and charger weighed about 9 lbs, each notebook weighed around 3 lbs, my two thick textbooks were almost 5 lbs each. My backpack on a busy day could have had three or four notebooks, my laptop and charger, either of my textbooks. I must have been carrying 20 lbs or more on my back. I had to find a way to go lighter. So I traded the heavy and yet still not adequate gaming laptop for a 2 in 1 productivity laptop and a powerful desktop. I started taking my notes in Microsoft OneNote and I use online textbooks whenever I can. Now instead of 20 lbs my everyday carry is closer to 6 lbs.

[John poses the question 'Is Print Media Still Relevant in the 'Digital Age'?".](https://johnwrd112.wordpress.com/2020/01/26/is-print-media-still-relevant-in-the-digital-age/) Of course it is. If you're trying to go paperless, you're ahead of the times. Many of our classes at UK don't offer digital versions of textbooks and some professors refuse to allow notes to be taken on iPads in their class despite the freshmen class being provided with them for that very reason. In some cases businesses going paperless [only leads to the use of more paper.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6znevn/a_rant_on_going_paperless_which_has_only_led_to/) The software isn't perfect either. I love using OneNote it allows me to organize my notes, annotate them, Import PDFs/Graphs, and move sentences around to be more clear without having to completely re-write them. Although palm rejection works pretty well anytime the pen is close to the screen, I can not count the number of times an on-screen keyboard has appeared in the middle of a sentence after accidentally tapping the screen. Despite being one of the best note taking programs OneNote is crippled on iOS, missing a lot of features of the windows version. 

[Google almost built the universal library.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/) A secret effort code named Project Ocean, it would have been a digitization of literally every book that had been printed. The mass of information that is the printed word out scales the data on the internet by orders of magnitude. 99% of all of the worlds wealth of information is out of reach to most people and will be unless a project like Google's is allowed to come to fruition. But even if such a database is created, it would not cause print media to fall to the wayside. In order for print media to fall out of fashion completely it would have to no longer be produced. Even with our technology today, the complete switch from the printed word to the information super highway will require lots of infrastructure, back-end development, countless hours of scanning and processing, changes in legislation, and an entire paradigm shift of humanity as a whole.

### Algorithm for Hate. 

#### Jan 25th 2020

Algorithms are employed by social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in order to increase user engagement on the site. These companies keep the specifics of their algorithms secret, we have no way of knowing their exact mechanisms. However, it is clear that these algorithms seek to promote what appeals to our most base instincts. In some cases, for the worst. [Sacha Baron Cohen recently attacked Facebook's practices in handling misinformation at Never is Now, a summit on antisemitism and hate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDTOQUvpw7I) 

Cohen points out, stories that evoke fear or trigger outrage, true or false are more likely to be recommended to people on social media. Conspiracy theories and partisan lies are designed to evoke those emotions, causing lies to spread faster than truth. Recently, as a response to the spread of misinformation through political campaign ads, Twitter banned political ads from the site entirely. 

[Zuckerberg took a different stance,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE_Xf33FocA&feature=emb_title) Facebook will do no fact checking on political ads. Zuckerberg defends his position on the grounds that his company has no place in limiting free speech, and that the consumers of the information should decide for themselves what is true and what is not. (However Facebook does limit what can be shared and fact checks other information shared on the platform.) Cohen disagrees. "Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach." Facebook will promote content that aligns with the views of its users, if you pay Facebook to run an ad they will help you target that ad so that it reaches the people that are most likely to respond to it. 

When it comes to lies or the spread of racism and bigotry, as long as its classified as a 'political' advertisement Facebook will take your money and run the ad. Cohen points out "If Facebook were around in the 1930's it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'."

Many people who use Facebook have an implicit trust of the platform and of text based or video news. So much so that in 2016 my grandparents genuinely believed that Hillary Clinton was a pedophile sex trafficker. [*I shouldn't have to explain that this is false.*](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/headlines-twist-old-report-on-state-department/) Despite Facebook and Twitter being where many get their news today we must not forget that **they are not news platforms**. They generate revenue with *data driven targeted advertisements* disguised as a communication service. Real news platforms have standards of integrity and ethics for proper journalism. Facebook has profit calling the shots.
