### Paperless* Student

#### Feb 1st 2020

I never intended to go paperless. I was always the person that preferred the feel of paper. When I started college I had a backpack full of notebooks for each class, a thick gaming laptop that had to have its beastly charger brought along too if I wanted to use it to do anything for more than an hour and whatever textbook I had for the day. My Dell G7 and charger weighed about 9 lbs, each notebook weighed around 3 lbs, my two thick textbooks were almost 5 lbs each. My backpack on a busy day could have had three or four notebooks, my laptop and charger, either of my textbooks. I must have been carrying 20 lbs or more on my back. I had to find a way to go lighter. So I traded the heavy and yet still not adequate gaming laptop for a 2 in 1 productivity laptop and a powerful desktop. I started taking my notes in Microsoft OneNote and I use online textbooks whenever I can. Now instead of 20 lbs my everyday carry is closer to 6 lbs.

[John poses the question 'Is Print Media Still Relevant in the 'Digital Age'?".](https://johnwrd112.wordpress.com/2020/01/26/is-print-media-still-relevant-in-the-digital-age/) Of course it is. If you're trying to go paperless, you're ahead of the times. Many of our classes at UK don't offer digital versions of textbooks and some professors refuse to allow notes to be taken on iPads in their class despite the freshmen class being provided with them for that very reason. In some cases businesses going paperless [only leads to the use of more paper.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6znevn/a_rant_on_going_paperless_which_has_only_led_to/) The software isn't perfect either. I love using OneNote it allows me to organize my notes, annotate them, Import PDFs/Graphs, and move sentences around to be more clear without having to completely re-write them. Although palm rejection works pretty well anytime the pen is close to the screen, I can not count the number of times an on-screen keyboard has appeared in the middle of a sentence after accidentally tapping the screen. Despite being one of the best note taking programs OneNote is crippled on iOS, missing a lot of features of the windows version. 

[Google almost built the universal library.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/) A secret effort code named Project Ocean, it would have been a digitization of literally every book that had been printed. The mass of information that is the printed word out scales the data on the internet by orders of magnitude. 99% of all of the worlds wealth of information is out of reach to most people and will be unless a project like Google's is allowed to come to fruition. But even if such a database is created, it would not cause print media to fall to the wayside. In order for print media to fall out of fashion completely it would have to no longer be produced. Even with out technology today, the complete switch from the printed word to the information super highway will require lots of infrastructure, back-end development, countless hours of scanning and processing, changes in legislation, and an entire paradigm shift of humanity as a whole.

### Algorithm for Hate. 

#### Jan 25th 2020

Algorithms are employed by social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in order to increase user engagement on the site. These companies keep the specifics of their algorithms secret, we have no way of knowing their exact mechanisms. However, it is clear that these algorithms seek to promote what appeals to our most base instincts. In some cases, for the worst. [Sacha Baron Cohen recently attacked Facebook's practices in handling misinformation at Never is Now, a summit on antisemitism and hate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDTOQUvpw7I) 

Cohen points out, stories that evoke fear or trigger outrage, true or false are more likely to be recommended to people on social media. Conspiracy theories and partisan lies are designed to evoke those emotions, causing lies to spread faster than truth. Recently, as a response to the spread of misinformation through political campaign ads, Twitter banned political ads from the site entirely. 

[Zuckerberg took a different stance,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE_Xf33FocA&feature=emb_title) Facebook will do no fact checking on political ads. Zuckerberg defends his position on the grounds that his company has no place in limiting free speech, and that the consumers of the information should decide for themselves what is true and what is not. (However Facebook does limit what can be shared and fact checks other information shared on the platform.) Cohen disagrees. "Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach." Facebook will promote content that aligns with the views of its users, if you pay Facebook to run an ad they will help you target that ad so that it reaches the people that are most likely to respond to it. 

When it comes to lies or the spread of racism and bigotry, as long as its classified as a 'political' advertisement Facebook will take your money and run the ad. Cohen points out "If Facebook were around in the 1930's it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'."

Many people who use Facebook have an implicit trust of the platform and of text based or video news. So much so that in 2016 my grandparents genuinely believed that Hillary Clinton was a pedophile sex trafficker. [*I shouldn't have to explain that this is false.*](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/headlines-twist-old-report-on-state-department/) Despite Facebook and Twitter being where many get their news today we must not forget that **they are not news platforms**. They generate revenue with *data driven targeted advertisements* disguised as a communication service. Real news platforms have standards of integrity and ethics for proper journalism. Facebook has profit calling the shots.
