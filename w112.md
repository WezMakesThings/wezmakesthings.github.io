### Algorithm for Hate. 

#### Jan 25th 2020

Algorithms are employed by social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in order to increase user engagement on the site. These companies keep the specifics of their algorithms secret, we have no way of knowing their exact mechanisms. However it is clear that these algorithms seek to promote what appeals to our most base instincts. In some cases, for the worst. [Sacha Baron Cohen recently attacked Facebook's practices in handling misinformation at Never is Now, a summit on antisemitism and hate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDTOQUvpw7I) 

Cohen points out, stories that evoke fear or trigger outrage, true or false are more likely to be recommended to people on social media. Conspiracy theories and partisan lies are designed to evoke those emotions, causing lies to spread faster than truth. Recently, as a response to the spread of misinformation through political campaign ads, Twitter banned political ads from the site entirely. 

[Zuckerberg took a different stance,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE_Xf33FocA&feature=emb_title) Facebook will do no fact checking on political ads. Zuckerberg defends his position on the grounds that his company has no place in limiting free speech, and that the consumers of the information should decide for themselves what is true and what is not. (However Facebook does limit what can be shared and fact checks other information shared on the platform.) Cohen disagrees. "Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach." Facebook will promote content that aligns with the views of its users, if you pay Facebook to run a ad they will help you target that ad so that it reaches the people that are most likely to respond to it. 

When it comes to lies or the spread of racism and bigotry, as long as its classified as a 'political' advertisement Facebook will take your money and run the ad. Cohen points out "If Facebook were around in the 1930's it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'."

Many people who use Facebook have an implicit trust of the platform and of text based or video news. So much so that in 2016 my grandparents genuinely believed that Hillary Clinton was a pedophile sex trafficker. Despite Facebook and Twitter being where many get their news today we must not forget that **they are not news platforms**. They generate revenue with *data driven targeted advertisements* disguised as a communication service. Real news platforms have standards of integrity and ethics for proper journalism. Facebook has profit calling the shots.
