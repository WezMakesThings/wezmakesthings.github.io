### About

I've had a passion for making for as long as I can remember. The ability to take an idea and materialize it in the real world is exciting to me. I enjoy learning new skills and techniques for creating. The scope of my interests spans far beyond just mechanical engineering. I am experienced in pcb design and manufacturing, programming, manual and CNC machining, I even tried casting this past summer. 
Recently I've been inspired by small multi-rotor UAVs and have been working on an independent research study involving the design of a collective pitch rotor for use in large multi-rotor vehicles where electric motors are not practical or safe. 

### Reason for creating this blog

I've been casually making cool stuff for a long time but until now I haven't set up a place to share what I do with others. This blog is going to mainly cover my personal projects. Recently I've been applying more and more of what I've learned in class to these projects.
