We finally have a real proper CNC Mill! Here's the first project I've made on the thing. A simple wrench.

This mill is leaps ahead of the lightweight machines we have on a table that gave everyone a heart attack when milling aluminum.
The machine is heaps easier to use as well and modern. I'm excited to continue using this for future projects.
