title: Lathe Spindle Bearing Upgrade
---

The lathe I have is most likely a harbor freight caliber machine. A major problem with these are the spindle bearings. Rather than something that can handle a large axial load (like those experienced in machining) it comes assembled with large ball bearings. These are great at radial loads, but weak at supporting the radial direction. Because of this, I've chosen to upgrade to tapered roller bearings.

I replaced the ball bearings with 30206 tapered roller bearings. These could be sourced relatively cheap in comparison to sealed angular contact bearings which would arguably be better for the task and wouldn't require periodic greasing. But I'm a broke college student and $6 bearings are better than $60 bearings for me. In the image above the bearing is not packed with grease. This is a rooky mistake. I should have packed the bearings during assembly. Current plan is to use a syringe filled with a thick grease to get these things ready to handle some machining. However I have to do some research on what kind of grease I should use. Maybe I'll still just end up using bicycle grease anyway. We'll see.
