title: One Wheel out of Scrap
---

Hoverboards, the self balancing scooters that started being produced en-mass in 2014. There have been many instances of units catching fire. It is widely regarded as an issue of quality control of the high current devices or perhaps sketchy Li-ion cells. Because of this and the fact that some would simply throw people off of them. They are largely banned everywhere. The dorm I live in goes so far to ban all forms of electric people mover with a few exceptions. Basically if it doesn't look like a hoverboard and it can't be chained up outside it's overlooked. Electric skateboards and notably the *One Wheel* is allowed around in the dorm. 

This is understandable, electric skateboards are not known for catching fire, even custom built ones. The hardware is a lot more trusted. The *One Wheel* is designed in California and made in California. It also costs between $950 if you get the pint, to $1,799 for the XR. A lot of money for something that in theory has the same operating principal as a hoverboard. 

Hoverboards are largely e-waste, though I've been surprised to see them still sold at Walmart for around $150. Though you can get some new or used on eBay for about $40. Then in theory with a 6" Go kart tire and some aluminum one could construct their own *One Wheel* clone for very little money. Assuming they have access to a CNC machine or other adequate tooling.

Thanks to kart racing being a thing there are also people selling lightly used racing slicks on eBay. I was able to get a tire for about $20. 6.00/11-5 size. I combined this with an inner tube as well to avoid needing to make the rim air tight. 

The control electronics will be a rewired version of the Hoverboard controller. I'm a little worried about the PID loop being upset with the change in wheel diameter and relocation of the gyro. But in my initial research [ZblaB has been able to get this to work](https://evnerds.com/electric-vehicles/e-unicycle-hoverboard-news/diy-onewheel-electric-skateboard-from-poland/) so it's likely this won't be too big of an issue. Though it could cause a steeper learning curve to ride than a real *One Wheel*.

I'm building this mainly out of reclaimed materials. Scrap aluminum discarded by the university machine shops, used hoverboard parts, used tire, scrap wood. It'll be a recycled machine capable of being my daily driver on campus.
