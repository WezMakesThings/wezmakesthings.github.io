title: Club Recruiting

We we're celebrities at the engineering club events, not so much when you invite the entirety of the university.

As now president of the Kentucky Organization of Robotics and Automation, I'm proud to say that recruiting went really well overall. We had over 120 responses to our interest survey. We do anticipate maybe only 20 to 30 to stick with the club. It's great to talk to new people who are passionate about robotics. This is going to be a great year for RMC.
