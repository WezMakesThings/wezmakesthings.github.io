title: Why don't you just put a generator in your trunk?

#### Exploring an interesting option for EV owners.
I own a 2017 Kia Soul EV, a ~compliance~ car only sold in California and Georgia for the US. I found mine used for a decent price in Ohio. I've been driving the car for almost a year now and I've fully transitioned to the 2017 era EV lifestyle. 
I've explained to more people than I care to count that I just charge it at home, and while 93 miles may not seem like a lot, I rarely drive that much anyway. Though I always get the generator question.

I had honestly been looking for an excuse to talk about my car here though this is my Engineering Blog not my Used Car Blog. That being said it is the most comfortable car I've ever drove and being liberated from the comparatively jerky unpredictable motion of an ICE car with an automatic transmission makes me wonder why CVTs still mimic shift patterns. The car has all that electric torque off the line and even though it isn't very quick it is quite fun beating pickup trucks that like to step on the gas light to light as their engines take time to get into the power band. 

The reason I wanted to go electric for the first car I would own is because I realized people my age are going to be the first generation that could go their entire life without owning a gasoline powered car, and I thought that would be an interesting side quest to add to my life. I care about the environment as much as the next guy, though the real reason I was attracted to electric cars was operating cost. 

I had to buy used, I'm a broke college student, and anything ICE powered that I bought used would likely either have issues or develop them and I wanted to not be beholden to fluctuating gas prices.
All else being equal an electric car costs way less to drive than a gasoline powered car. Lets take my Kia Soul EV and the 2017 Kia Soul as an example. 

The 2017 Soul gets 26mpg city / 31mpg highway, call it 28.5mpg average. My car sees a measured efficiency of about 4.5 miles per kilowatt hour. At the time of writing a gallon of unleaded is about ~$2.19, the price per kilowatt hour where I live is $0.12. 
Cost per mile driven for each car: 
Soul ICE: 7.68 cents per mile 
*Soul EV: 2.67 cents per mile.* 
It costs only a *third* of what it would cost me to drive the ICE equivalent of my car. **You would need an ICE car that could get just over 80mpg consistently in order to beat my EV**. Granted this requires that I always charge at home.

Back to the generator question: Without fail, I get this question and until recently I haven't had a good answer. What sparked my interest on this again is Ford switching the F-150-EV to a hybrid instead of all electric.

##### *I really like the enclosed front styling, it looks similar to my Kia Soul. though most images of the truck just have a regular boring grill and nothing to differentiate it as an EV*

Yup Ford recently patented a small gasoline motor, connected to a generator, connected to an inverter to charge the traction battery. (*So the BMW i3 REX trim.. whatever*) I assume this stems from a focus group where range anxiety must have came up. Now the Ford electric truck is a hybrid, I'm interested to see if they will offer the truck without the range extender and what the price attached to it will be. I've been following the development of many electric trucks and this comes as a strange choice. Usually when people want to run electric tools from their pick up truck, they bring a generator in the back, now with the truck being electric you can plug directly into the truck and forgo the generator. This is actually something I do with my car. I have an inverter and also many of my things run right off 12 volts. Even with my "small" battery I can do a lot. Ford not missing this opportunity has 120 volt and 240 volt outlets right in the truck bed. Though if you already got a generator, and you're avoiding switch to an EV because of range anxiety, there's nothing stopping you from bringing the generator you already own to charge your truck.

Lets look at my Soul EV again, lets say I were to buy a generator. Without mods my car wont run while plugged in, I need it to be a high wattage output, since I can only charge while parked and I don't want to take as long.

For just under $950 you can order a 9500watt continuous generator. Its pretty large at 27.2x26.1x26.5inches which may be cumbersome for a Kia Soul, though no problem for a pickup. It quotes 12 hours of running time with a 6.6 gallon fuel tank. Ideally the generator would charge my car in 3 hours, and could charge my car ~4 times. The equivalent mpg for using this generator would be a staggering 73mpg. It would also be capable of charging my car at 9.5kW, notably faster than public charging in the area at 6.6kW (4 hours) and my level 2 home charger at 3.8kW (7 hours). It would cost about $3.62 (as of today) to charge to full which, is only $0.13 cents per kilowatt, 1 cent more than charging at home per kilowatt hour and 1.5 cents less per kilowatt than charging to full at a public station near me. Though the price of gas is subject to change I could buy whenever/wherever I notice its slightly lower instead of as I need it.

Factoring in the initial cost of the generator does mean that I would have to drive 1,581.6 miles charging from the generator instead of public charging in order to actually be saving money by buying one, but this is interesting. A gasoline generator would allow my car to get similar mpg to a small motorcycle and has a running cost very close to that of straight up electric charging. Although I maintain that home charging is the way to go I do occasionally find myself having no other option than public charging, or resigning myself to being a few hours behind waiting to get enough range in my battery.

A generator this capable would probably not be practical to put in the back of my Kia Soul, though if I make the switch to an electric truck in 2022 I most likely will get one. Though people who already own one and a truck likely keep a generator in the back of their truck anyway and have no need for range anxiety should they choose to switch to an EV.
