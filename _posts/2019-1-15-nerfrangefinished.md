Working with my partner at Corman&Associates was quite nice. He was a cool dude and very agreeable. However I don't think I'll work with the company ever again in the future. 

I was really under-paid for the work I did for them. To be fair, I'm a college freshmen and this was my first time doing any sort of "engineering contract" work. I enjoyed the project and I like the way it came out. I didn't have a good reference as to how much time I would spend on the project nor what I should charge. But in the end I really undervalued my work.

I also feel like I was taken advantage of, when the project fell behind schedule and the panels for building the cabinet weren't even finished I was being blamed for my code not working. It worked on my end but not with the full length of wire. Threshold values needed to be changed. The company didn't handle it well, what could have been a 10 min fix caused some of the management to get really angry. Overall not a great experience. 

I'll also point out. Not once did they ask me to keep the project secret nor was it implied. There was no NDA. I was also paid under the table, so I feel no remorse for calling them out here. Early on in the project it was a lot of fun but it got worse as time went on.

Overall, I've learned my lesson. I know some steps I can take to find better work in the future.
