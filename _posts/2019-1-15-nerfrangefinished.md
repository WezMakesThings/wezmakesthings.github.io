Working with my partner at Corman&Associates was quite nice. He was a cool dude and very agreeable. However I don't think I'll work with the company ever again in the future. 

I was really under-paid for the work I did for them. To be fair, I'm a college freshmen and this was my first time doing any sort of "engineering contract" work. I enjoyed the project and I like the way it came out. I didn't have a good reference as to how much time I would spend on the project nor what I should charge. But in the end I really undervalued my work, I also feel like my inexperience with jobs was taken advantage of.

There was one point where threshold values in the code needed to be changed, but I had left for the day. The company didn't handle it well, what could have been a 30 second fix caused some of the management to get really angry. Overall not a great experience. 

I'll also point out. Not once did they ask me to keep the project secret nor was it implied. There was no NDA. I was also paid under the table, so I feel no remorse for calling them out here. Early on in the project it was a lot of fun but it got worse as time went on.

Overall, I've learned my lesson. I know some steps I can take to find better work in the future.
