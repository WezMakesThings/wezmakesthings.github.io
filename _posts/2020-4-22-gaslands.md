title: Gaslands

I haven't had the ability to work on many of my large projects due to now being without access to the university makerspace thanks to the pandemic. I've had to find other things to do to keep myself occupied. My parents introduced me to Gaslands, a tabletop war game played with hotwheels cars. You can just use regular hot wheels, put part of the fun is kitbashing and painting them up to make post-apocalyptic war machines.

This is going to be pretty image heavy...

If your not familiar with table top war games they can be pretty intimidating and tedious to work through the rules in order to play. I tried Warhammer 40k with my brother, but without the help of an experienced player we found ourselves stumbling through the rules and not having the best experience. Not the case with Gaslands! The rule book is only 64 pages, and it is fairly easy to understand all of the rules have a realistic logic to them and we we're able to teach ourselves the game and have fun. 

We've got the whole house in on it. (Little little bro is still working on his)

But that didn't stop us from painting up other toys:

We cut up old credit cards, window screen, leftovers from space marines WH40k kits, old action figures, a model tank, and were able to make these radical hot wheels. We've had a lot of fun with this and we're able to do all of it with things we've had laying around. This has been my first introduction to "kit bashing" and it's been a lot of fun. If you have leftover parts from model kits and some cars, I would recommend you give this a go, its an excellent creative outlet and doesn't take to much time or technique to make something really cool.
