### First video up on Youtube channel
I've decided I'm going to start putting these projects on a Youtube channel. Heres the first one I recorded from start to finish.

It took me about 2 hours to edit this together, I think I did a decent job. While I put a lot of work into this blog its kind of a hard thing to brag about to regular people. My main purpose for this blog since the start is that it would be a place where I showcase what I'm doing to potential employers or other interested parties. Though the walls of text I submit here aren't the most approachable or entertaining, so if I want to brag about my projects to the average person its a lot harder to impress them with my detailed write-ups than it is with a short video showcasing the project. That said I still enjoy the write-ups and I feel that a detailed write up is important for anyone wants to learn from what I do. 

This is a continuation of the tri-copter project so for more details on the actual build [click here.](https://wezley.net/tricopter/) 

The pumpkin was paper mache, I tried with an actual hallowed out pumpkin but it was far to heavy. Honestly in the time it took me to lay up the paper mache I could have 3d printed a multi part pumpkin and glued it together. Though it did look pretty convincing when it was up in the sky.

Here is the voltage divider board which connects to the balance connector of the battery. Rather than just read the voltage of one cell which would give an inaccurate reading of the whole battery would slowly bring one cell out of balance with the rest, I have a voltage divider across the ~12V potential to step it down to a valid input voltage for the flight controller. I chose large resistors to use as little current as possible.

Off of this board I have a very small buck converter which is rated for up to 3amps output. I didn't want to draw the 2 amps or so that the LEDs would need from the flight controller and risk it causing brown outs. This regulator also prevents me from having to use another battery which I would need to make another voltage divider to monitor.

I tested this with alligator clips and nothing got hot or smoked. So I continued on and wired this up in the pumpkin. The neopixels and arduino ended up being brighter and lighter than the electric tea lights I bought originally at only 11 grams. The neopixels also let me get a very pleasant and fun effect for the flames. 

I used [this code](https://github.com/schnoggo/jack-o-candle) which was actually published for use as a neopixel pumpkin light though with many more pixels. It works well enough with 6 though.
