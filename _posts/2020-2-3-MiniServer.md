title: Miniature NAS
---

There's a standard that's growing in popularity in the maker community for small computer hardware like raspberry pi's and 3d printer hardware. [The 6" Rack](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1936196) designed by KronBjorn on thingiverse. I need to find a use for the box of raspberry pi's I have collecting dust. So I've decided to gut two external hard drives and build a mini NAS.

#### WD External HDD.

Each of the drives contained a 2.5" HDD that was only 7mm tall. Perfect for fitting into the 6" Rack standard where each unit is 14mm. 

#### Finished print.

The hard drive unit uses 4 M3x40, 4 M3x5 screws, and is made up of three 3d printed parts totaling not more than 60 grams of plastic. All printed parts can be printed flat with no support. 

#### Mounted in the extrusion.
