UK Robotics is participating in NASA robotic mining competition this year. Our robot OSCAR has been a year in the making. I've been sort of constrained to the electrical/software side of things since Senior Design has been assigned the mechanical work as their capstone engineering project.

I am slightly worried about some aspects of the design. Mainly the wheels, the large forward/backward aspect ratio is really hurting us in the sand test. The wheel diameter isn't helping either they kinda dig into the sand. I would think senior engineering students would be able to pick these features out as being bad. I worry their need to carefully document their design process and reasoning distracted them from making a good design.

The digging and offloading equipment works rather well in our sandbox though, so if we can get to the digging area we shouldn't have any problem actually making it to the "icy regolith" which is located about 30cm from the surface. Though it is a little slow, it should be able to load up on several kg of rock.
