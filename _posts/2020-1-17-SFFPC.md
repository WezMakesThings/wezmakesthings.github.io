title: SFF PC Case WIP
---

For a while now I've been on a quest to make the perfect sff pc case. It must be powerful, small enough to fit in a backpack to be lugged around, look good, and cost less than a case I could buy.

Pictured above is the 4th physical version of the case and the 6th digital revision.
I've been trying some new techniques with what I have on hand to make the manufacture of this version much faster than other ones. Rather than 3D printing the bulk of the case is laser cut wood with two kerf bends. These will be filled with wood glue and saw dust and sanded smooth.

Overall dimensions of the case are 181mm x 106mm x 245mm (7.1in x 4.1in x 9.6in) The weird numbers come from using a combination of mm and inches in the design due to the country I live in. This will be the last version of the case I build. Once I finish it I am not going to make another case unless I get new hardware or a new PC.

Next post on sff cases will be the finished product and a little more info on the specs of the build.

### Recap
![Version 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PCcase.PNG)

Above is the first version of this case, a combination of 3d printed bracket corners and laser cutting. This case was to big to fit in my backpack however, so it didn't fit my criteria.

The 2nd version was closer to what I wanted. However it had some thermal issues due to the strange component layout. It also wasn't very space efficient and had no room for an exhaust fan. Print also warped causing some funky repairs to be required. This design had side panels but they aren't pictured here since they required gluing.

3rd iteration, tried a different style. I ended up just not liking it. I never made side panels (that worked) and I got my fan clearance wrong so I still couldn't mount the exhaust fan.
