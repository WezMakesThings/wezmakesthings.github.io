title: Is the iPad a laptop replacement?
---

### Not really...

This post is going to be a slight deviation from my others. This isn’t a project so much as it is a recap of my experience attempting to use an iPad as my daily machine for a few days in college. 

Starting 2019 all freashmen at the University of Kentucky we’re given iPads in an attempt to increace student success. They chose iPad’s as opposed to say, cromebooks, since they determined that of all devices on UK’s wifi a whopping 70% ran iOS. Mind you that figure isn’t mobile devices, thats ALL devices. So, iPads. 

Apple advertises their iPads as “laptop replacements” but what does the iPad do well? What does it do poorly or not at all? These are the questions I want to answer, when I stole my girlfriends iPad.

I’m currently writing this on the iPad in *CodeHub* a github client. It works well enough for text though I’ve not figured out yet how to add images. I also assume it would be pretty dificult to develop much more than a blog in this app. I also really miss the spellcheck I get in notepad++. 

OneNote and Photoshop are where the iPad really shine. If you have the opertunity to use either of the Apple Pencils take it. It is by far the nicest writing and drawing experience on any device. What prompted me to try this out was that my windows ink pen for my HP bricked for no reason. Issues I’ve had on other devices don’t happen on the iPad, writing is smooth diagonal lines arn’t jittery, I don’t get a lot of random touch inputs when resting and lifting my palm to write. Photoshop with Adobe cloud is how all programs should work. It is the most cross platfrom app I have used to date. The iPad version doesn’t feel crippled and cloud files sync quickly and can be oppened on iPadOS, MacOS, and Windows seamlessly. I’ve never had a smoother experience trying to use files between devices.

That said there are many things I do withen a day that can’t be done on the iPad. I work in the university makerspace and a big part of the is CAD/CAM, slicing 3D prints and exporting files to SD card or usb drive. These kind of tasks can only really be done on a laptop. “Laptop replacement” doesn’t really fit the iPad. It’s more like a “notebook replacement”. I was also unable to add any images to this post, partially because the app doesn’t support it partially because I can’t store the gitHub repo on the iPad. Manipulating files is some what of a chore on iPad. Except for certain instances which are specifically designed so that you don’t need to open the files app at all. The keyboard feels crampt. Typing up long text is somewhat uncomfortable. 

So in conclusion the iPad is a great note taking and cloud device. But not yet a laptop replacement. For the iPad to begin replacing laptops we will need to see a lot more features arise. I’m writing this on an iPad air so I don’t have the ability to explore the capability of the iPad pro’s usb-c port. However, we really need the ability to develop apps for the iPad on the iPad. This would make the iPad a true app ecosystem where users are developers and can contribute to creating great user experience rather than the one way street that is the app store. This may be wishful thinking but if Apple gave us Xcode on the iPad and other dev tools we could really see the iPad take off as more than a note taking machine.
