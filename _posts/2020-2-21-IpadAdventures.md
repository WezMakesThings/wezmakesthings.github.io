title: Is the iPad a laptop replacement?
---

### Not really...

This post is going to be a slight deviation from my others. This isn’t a project so much as it is a recap of my experience attempting to use an iPad as my daily machine in college. 

Starting 2019 all freashmen at the University of Kentucky we’re given iPads in an attempt to increace student success. They chose iPad’s as opposed to say, cromebooks, since they determined that of all devices on UK’s wifi a whopping 70% ran iOS. Mind you that figure isn’t mobile devices, thats ALL devices. So, iPads. 

Apple advertises their iPads as “laptop replacements” but what does the iPad do well? What does it do poorly or not at all? These are the questions I want to answer, when I stole my girlfriends iPad.
