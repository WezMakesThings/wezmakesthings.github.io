title: Blade for Laser Sword

I tried using LED strips I already had for this project, but I'm sure glad I got some super dense neopixels instead, the effect is perfect.

These are individually addressable allowing each light to be controlled independently. I can create the animations for the blade deploying and retracting with ease, as well as set the color to just about any of them imaginable.
