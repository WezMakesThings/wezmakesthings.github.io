title: Laptop Dock

Simple 3d print this time, but one that allows me to get a lot more desk space. I'm working with just a laptop right now and I've found that its hard to fit a notebook/textbook the laptop and other stuff on the small dorm desks. This is a way for me to set the laptop up out of the way. 

The dock connects the laptop to Ethernet, HDMI, and USB peripherals all at once through thunderbolt. Sadly the power connection is on the other side of the laptop, meaning there's an ugly and impractical power cable jutting from the top. Its nice to be able to use my laptop like a desktop while at my dorm and then just pick it up and throw it in my bag for class.
