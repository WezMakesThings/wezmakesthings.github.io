title: CNC Mini Lathe WIP

My highschool got rid of an old mini lathe the same year I graduated and I decided to take it home. 200lbs of cast iron taken home on the bus. It was quite the adventure.

I've tried to learn the basics of using a lathe on the machine but it had way to much backlash in all axis to be used in anything but simple projects. This is the beginning of a rebuild project to convert it to cnc. However, it's going to be difficult to keep the momentum of this project going while I live in a dorm since all of the parts are heavy and I have to move between places often.

Pictured above is the first change to the lathe. I've used the UK makerspace to drill and tap holes in the cast iron to mount a ball screw. The main screw didn't have much backlash but it was old and didn't turn smoothly. It had a lot of friction and rust. I decided It would be better to start over with something more modern than acme threaded rod.
