title: Small Heat Sink for Motor Controller
---

I'm working on a electric long board made from recycled and new parts. The motor controller I found requires a heat sink to keep the transistors from melting.

I'm going to be honest, this heat sink was designed more around the limitations of our tooling than it was designed to be a good heat sink. This functioned as a good introduction to milling metal for me which has been a new experience.

In my research I found that heat sinks are usually manufactured by extrusion or using horizontal milling with cutting disks. Processes a freshman engineering student doesn't have access to. The maker space at UK has wonderful staff who helped me learn the basics of milling metal.

Tool paths we're made in fusion360. They are rather conservative due to machine we have being rather lightweight.
