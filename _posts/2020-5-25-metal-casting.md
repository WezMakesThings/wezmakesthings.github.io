*Getting the foundry up to temp.*

Yesterday I built and fired a small foundry with my Dad. This is a project I've been wanting to try for years though I guess since I'm now an adult I have a little more room to decide what gets lit on fire.

This project has the goal of recycling aluminum cans into parts that can be finished machined for larger projects, though at the moment we're trying to get some ingots made. 

The procedure being followed for making the small charcoal fed foundry was developed by Grant Thompson in 2015 and can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHD10DjxM1g).

This was all we were able to make yesterday, we did get up to melting temperature however our forced air input was held in by some duct-tape, at such high temperatures the adhesive failed and we had to put a stop to the process until we can buy a few more parts. Notice there are some spots of shiny aluminum that did melt however its integrated with slag. This is about five cans worth and if we we're able to melt more cans or keep it at high heat we would have been able to separate the dross from the metal. This is not a loss however since the next firing can simply start with this amalgamation and we should be able to recover the useful material.

Here was our setup.

Stop me if you can already tell what stupid mistake was made.

See that blow drier attached directly to that steel pipe that is conducting all of the heat inside the foundry? Turns out tape doesn't stick to stuff that's 1200 degrees F. When that tape fell off we lost the forced air and instantly started loosing heat. Though I did get some practice lifting the crucible out of the foundry which I appreciated. 

The new parts that I need to buy are actually in the instructions I just ignored them. But if I didn't share my mistakes you might think I'm perfect or something. The parts are threaded pvc pipe that will act like an insulator for the coupling that will hold the hair drier. I'm picking those up today to hopefully do another firing this afternoon.
