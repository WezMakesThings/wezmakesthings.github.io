The UK college of engineering hosts an event yearly on the 22nd called E-Day. Its a large outreach event where people from all over the state come to tour and explore the many clubs and research happening at the UK COE.

I am part of the robotics club and in order to entertain our guests we built a small robot that could be controlled over wifi with a twist.

The robot was controllable from a smartphone or really any device capable of running HTML5 and used websockets to send commands to the robot. The catch was only one wheel could be controlled by each person. 

The robots motors were strong enough that with only two people there was enough control to get it moving which was satisfying to a lot of the kids. But when four kids told each motor to go forward the robot went flying, usually into someones ankles. Most of the time though they lacked to coordination to get the robot moving in a straight line. Which makes me glad we didn't put the effort of building the originally planned obstacle course. It was entertaining and challenging enough to just get the robot to roll over some sand bags occasionally.
