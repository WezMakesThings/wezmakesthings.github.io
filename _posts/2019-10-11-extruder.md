title: 3D printer extruder upgrade
---

![assembly]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3dprinter/extruderassem.jpg)
My roommate and I are passionate about 3D printing. We've been working together to develop a printer. This is the first part of the first prototype. I'm working on the physical design and he's doing the programming. 

The components pictured here are a Mosquito hot end, Bondtech extruder and Pinda probe. Ideally we'd like to replace the pinda with a piezo sensor similar to what was used in [this project]({{ site.baseurl }}/nerfrange/).

My goal in this project is to create the most ridged structure so that the computer doesn't have to compensate quite so much for a bad design like it seems like in some other printers. We don't want to use the software as a crutch for bad hardware.
