title: Casting a useful part.

The DIY Onewheel project requires a part to join the two large BLDC motors so that a tire can mount between them. Originally this part was going to be machined out of aluminum round stock. Instead I decided to take a chance at the relatively low accuracy of casting from a 3d printed pattern.

I had bought some greensand in a small quantity from Jeff. I could have made my own but this reduced the variables and gave me one less failure mode.

An important constraint was the volume of my crucible. The part had to be completed in a single pour and I had the ability to melt five of my muffin ingots, or about 375g of aluminum. I had to make sure the cad mass estimate was much lower than this, since the part also required an inlet and exit. This resulted in a tapered weight reduction hole through the center of the part.

Using this technique I was able to get the two faces as parallel as I have the ability to measure without proper equipment. (Such as a surface plate.) Measuring with my calipers on opposite points I got a difference of about one tenth of a millimeter. All that was left was to bolt the two halves together and inflate the inner tube.
