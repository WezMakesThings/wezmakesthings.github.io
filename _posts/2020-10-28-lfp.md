title: Large format 3D printer
---

I'm currently heading up the construction of a large 3d printer with build dimensions of 1000mm x 500mm x 500mm. This project is part of the robotics club KORA at the University of Kentucky. The goal is to have a large scale 3d printer that can manufacture large parts for our robot out of durable yet lightweight plastics like poly carbonate for the NASA Lunabotics Competition. Here is the printer so far in its current state:

We want to print large sections of the robot since it will allow us to use computer optimized topology and manufacture parts that would otherwise be difficult to manufacture or cost prohibitive. Since we are building a mock lunar rover, low mass is paramount and structural optimizations by artificial intelligence allows us to keep weight down and strength up. However, these kinds of optimizations would be impossible to realize without a large scale additive manufacturing machine. 

I designed this printer with the idea that I would need to reduce the moving mass as much as possible so that vibrations and mechanical loads could be kept to a minimum, which is why the motion design deviates from the common Prusa/Mendel or Ultimaker/CoreXY designs. The design is similar to a really tall cnc router and is similar to the one used in UMaine's extremely large printer:

My design has a couple important distinctions that help keep its overall volume very close to its actual build volume and keeps the cost down using off the shelf parts. We've taken to calling this the "Mitchell Architecture" for 3d printers. For printers of similar volume and capabilities, my design costs one tenth the cost of purchasing one.

While this design does have a gantry that runs back and forth for the Y axis much like UMaine's design and small cnc routers like the Shopbot rather than building the Z axis as a vertical beam the Z axis moves the X axis extrusions so that when the hotend is at the maximum Z travel there isn't a vertical beam extending just as far up above the printer. The enclosure for such a printer or cnc router would need to be twice as high as the build height, much like the building that contains UMain's printer. Rather than waste this space, moving the relatively lightweight X axis extrusions along the Z axis was the method I chose.

In order to move this gantry along the Y axis, I'm using a single open loop belt and NEMA motors fixed to the gantry with this belt path.

With this loop I can adjust to an appropriate tension and get adequate belt pulley engagement to prevent the belt from slipping. An open belt also helps lower cost and complexity since it can be simply fixed to each end of the printer.

We're using a Slice Engineering Mosquito and a Bondtech BMG in order to enable the printer to use high temperature plastics such as poly carbonate. The Mosquito can reach temperatures of 500 degrees C and has excellent thermal isolation. The Bondtech extruder grips the filament on each side and will allow the printer to run at high mm/s feed rates with a large diameter nozzle.

Will update when we're printing!
