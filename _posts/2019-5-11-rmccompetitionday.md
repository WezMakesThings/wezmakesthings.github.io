Thanks to the government shutdown NASA was unable to host this years competition at Kennedy Space Center. Which is disappointing, thankfully though the University of Alabama was able to prepare their facilities to host many robots for the remote competition.

You'll see me there in the ppe furthest right. Preparing the robot for its 10 min run in the BP-1 stimulant. 

The robot preformed in ways we couldn't easily anticipate as first time contestants. The wheels worked okay, they had turning problems but they didn't dig in nearly as much as in the sand. The limestone was much denser than the play sand, which helped it roll nicely. Our digger which worked well in the sandbox had many issues in the limestone. The profile of the digger was wider than the buckets themselves so after digging in a little ways it couldn't push any further into the ground and in one case actually lifted the robot.

I spent nearly the whole time programming the module that would get camera data from the robot to our control computers. A big part of this competition is being able to control the robot with limited telemetry data and lag to simulate the robot being far remote on mars. No line of sight control is allowed and (typically) artificial lag is introduced (though that was absent from this years competition). This was all done in the days leading up to our actual runs, last minuet in the dark basement of one of the buildings at U of A. 

The time I spent in Tuscaloosa was super fun. I formed some great friendships and I learned a lot from many experts that attended the competition I got to talk with some senior mechanical engineers at CATAPILLAR and learned a lot about autonomy in robotics and its applications for large scale construction and mining vehicles.
