title: Modular Keyboard Experiments

I've been experimenting with keyboard designs lately. It's starting to seem like every rabbit hole of obscure interests there is I'll climb down it. This is a 40% ortho-linear keyboard designed around the constraints of the UK makerspace.

We recently got some pcb mills. I was thinking I'd tackle a project with them. This keyboard is made out of three 4x4 key modules and designed to us MX switches and a separate control board.

This design fits easily in the stock we have and is single sided. The keys are arranged in a regular grid so that each module does not need to be different.
