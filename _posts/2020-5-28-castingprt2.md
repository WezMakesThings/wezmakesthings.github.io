title: Ingots, Observations and Next Steps

So I was able to make some mini-muffin shaped ingots. As well as a lot of slag.
This is exciting since I was able to actually get a larger quantity of molten metal and I was able to pour clean aluminum.

These are the two clean ingots which total out to 140 grams of aluminum. Roughly ten cans worth.

The most prominent issue was how many times we needed to refuel the foundry. Once it was lit we needed to pack it with charcoal four or five times as we we're melting cans. This is likely related to how long it took us to get the cans into the forge. They had to be done one at a time and due to the size of the crucible each one had to be guided in. In the future I think time would be well spent cutting or shredding the cans into strips so the crucible can be packed with raw material, fired, then poured quickly as possible.

The other main issue was slag. Before the pour I couldn't easily remove the slag from the crucible with the tongs I was using and it didn't float to the top like I expected either. This was disappointing since I only got about a third of the ingots I was expecting from the volume of material in my crucible. A friend who does art casting suggested cleaning the paint off the cans with a wire brush though I'm going to reserve that as a last resort. Some sources suggest acetone can remove the ink from cans. Could be worth a shot.

Next steps towards the first functional casting.

Here's the current design for the wheel hub casting, this part will be drilled and tapped to allow two slightly modified hover board wheels. Its designed with fillets and a draft angle of 5 degrees. This part will be printed in two halves and I have two ways I could make a casting mold.

Foundry green sand can be bought relatively cheep in quantities of ten pounds from amazon. Which I'm told equates to about a 6" cube of volume, which would be more than enough for this small part and any other small parts I could create with the small crucible and foundry I built. The pattern would be 3d printed and wouldn't need to be destroyed.

I would like to try a shell casting as well. I figure I could use Plaster of Paris as the ceramic slurry. My only issue is how would I do multiple dips for a thicker coating without all of my plaster drying up on me. This would also require both the mould and pattern to be lost in the process.
Next I need to melt a lot more cans and also do more research on preparing moulds.
